# Weekly Team Status Reports
 Team report contains the following section:

* Section 1: It should be an exact copy of the third section from last week that is, your goals from a week ago. (It can be empty for the first)
* Section 2: Should report the progress made this week: what we've done, what worked, what we learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
Here, we can  also indicate the roles and responsibilities/tasks of each team member in the recent week.
* Section 3: Should outline  plans and goals for the following week.
