## ABOUT TEST
### T-TEST
The t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution under the null hypothesis. A t-test is the most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow a normal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the test statistic were known. We are performing T-Test and U-Test on Meta Protein Dataset, provided with the code. 


* t is the t-test statistic value
* df is the degrees of freedom
* p-value is the significance level of the t-test 
* conf.int is the confidence interval of the mean at 95%
* sample estimates is he mean value of the sample


### U-TEST
In statistics, the Mannâ€“Whitney U test is a nonparametric test of the null hypothesis that, for randomly selected values X and Y from two populations, the probability of X being greater than Y is equal to the probability of Y being greater than X.
