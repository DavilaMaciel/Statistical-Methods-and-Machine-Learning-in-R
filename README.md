# Learn R for Bio-Informatics:
By clicking on the provided link under this paragraph you will come across the pipeline to learn R in order to improve or learn your Analytical skills for bio-information research. Our team has provided three files for each topic.<br/>
<br/>

* One of them will be a **.ppt** file, in order to get the theoretical slides. <br/>
* Second file will be containing the code corresponding to the slides having **.R** file format. <br/> 
* Third file will be a **.jpg** file with Quiz questions. <br/>
* Fourth file will be a **.R** file but there you will find the solution to Quiz, described in **.jpg** file. <br/>

# R-Scripts for Bio-Informatics:
To make the contribution open-source, our team has uploaded all the scripts in R language. This may help to understand the usage of Programming in Bio-Informatic. Moreover, under the provided links you will find sub folders each containing a Data-set file, a Programming script in R, and a Read_me file (description about the program). In order to get the access to the scripts click on the links mentioned below.

# Theoretical Concepts:

Apart from Codes our team has also gathered the theoretical approach to all the ANALYSIS which we automated using R. To get the link to that Section click on the link provided under this line: <br/>
