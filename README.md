# DE_Project_MetaProtStat
The aim of this project is to develop an R-based bioinformatic workflow consisting of basic statistics, machine learning and data visualization for biologist to support their data evaluation

# R-Scripts for Bio-Informatics:
    To make the contribution open-source, our team has uploaded all the scripts in R language. This may help to understand the usage of Programming in Bio-Informatic. Moreover, under the providid links you will find sub folders each containing a Data-set file, a Programming script in R, and a Read_me file (description about the program). In order to get the access to the scripts click on the links mentioned below.

* [UNSUPERVISED LEARNING](https://github.com/Rizvix0/Statistical-Methods-and-Machine-Learning-in-R/tree/master/Unsupervised%20Learning).
* [SIGNIFICANCE DIFFERENTIAL TESTS](https://github.com/Rizvix0/Statistical-Methods-and-Machine-Learning-in-R/tree/master/Significance%20Differential%20Tests).

 **Do not forget to clon the repository to you GITHUB-DEKSTOP. This way you will get the folders on your dekstop(with all the datasets and scripts)**

# Theoratical Concepts:

Apart from Codes our team has also gathered the theoratical approach to all the ANALYSIS which we automated using R. To get the link to that Section click on the link provided under this line/
