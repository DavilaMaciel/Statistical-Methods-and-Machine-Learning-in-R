# Learn R for Bio-Informatics:
By clicking on the provided link under this paragraph you will come across the pipeline to learn R in order to improve or learn your Analytical skills for bio-information research. Our team has provided three files for each topic.<br/>
<br/>

* One of them will be **.ppt** file, in order to get the theoratical slides. <br/>
* Second file will be containing the code for respective topic having **.R** file format. <br/> 
* Third file will be a **.jpg** file with Quiz questions. <br/>
* Thrid file will also be **.R** file but there you will find the solution to Quiz, descriped in **.jpg** file.

# R-Scripts for Bio-Informatics:
To make the contribution open-source, our team has uploaded all the scripts in R language. This may help to understand the usage of Programming in Bio-Informatic. Moreover, under the providid links you will find sub folders each containing a Data-set file, a Programming script in R, and a Read_me file (description about the program). In order to get the access to the scripts click on the links mentioned below.
